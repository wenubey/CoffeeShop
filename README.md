# CoffeeShop App

## Overview
CoffeeShop App is an innovative Android application developed using Kotlin. It provides a seamless coffee shop experience, with features like menu browsing, order customization, and tracking. The app adheres to clean code principles, employing the Repository pattern and MVVM architecture for robustness and maintainability. It uses Koin for dependency injection and Room for local data persistence.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio
- Git

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
git clone [repository-url]
2. **Open the Project**: 
Open the cloned project in Android Studio.
3. **Sync Gradle**: 
Allow Android Studio to sync the project with all the necessary dependencies.
4. **Run the App**: 
Use an emulator or a real device to run the app.

## Architecture

The app is structured following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Data and business logic layer.
- **View**: UI components.
- **ViewModel**: Bridge between Model and View.

## Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern abstracts the data layer, providing a clean API for data access to the rest of the application.

## Dependency Injection with Koin

Koin simplifies the process of providing and managing dependencies across the app.

## Room Database

Room is used for local data persistence, enabling offline access and data caching.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- **AndroidX Libraries**
- **Room Database**
- **Gson**
- **Koin**

## Testing

- **JUnit**: For unit testing.
- **Espresso**: For UI testing.
- **AndroidX Test Libraries**: For additional testing utilities.
